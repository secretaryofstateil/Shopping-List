# Shopping-List
Shopping List is a program that allows users to create a shopping list for any need!

Shopping List utilizes the functions associated with lists in Python to compile an easy-to-use shopping list. Upon running Shopping List, users will encounter a menu with multiple options numbered 1 - 8 with varying descriptions and functions. The user will be prompted to input a number, which will in turn run the corresponding function. The options are as follows:

  1. Add an item to the shopping list
  2. View the current shopping list
  3. Mark an item as completed
  4. Remove an item from the shopping list
  5. Clear shopping list
  6. Sort shopping list in alphabetical order
  7. Count number of items in the shopping list
  8. Exit the program

Option numbers 1, 3, & 4 require user input to edit the current shopping list. Inputs are specific and case-sensitive. If the user is unsure about previous entries, option 3 in the menu provides a display of the current items list. 

Option numbers 3, 5, 6, & 7 utilize functions to run the listed description. The program will continue to run until option number 8 closes the program by breaking the while True loop.
